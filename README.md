# _Spark-Study_
A personal project to go with my study/experiments on Spark/Scala/Big Data stuff. I forked a skeleton project from (faizanahemad) to skip the steps to start a project from scratch. 

## Prerequisites
- [Java](https://java.com/en/download/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)

## Build and Demo process

### Clone the Repo
`git clone https://github.com/clarencechiang/spark-study.git`

### Build
`./gradlew clean build`
### Run
`./gradlew run`
### All Together
`./gradlew clean run`

## Using this Repo
Just import it into your favorite IDE as a gradle project. Tested with IntelliJ to work. Or use your favorite editor and build from command line with gradle.
